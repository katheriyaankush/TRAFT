Feature: Dashboard UI Enhancement

  As a user
  I want to have an enhanced dashboard UI
  So that I can have a better user experience and easily access the information I need

  Scenario: Improved layout and design
    Given I am logged into the application
    When I navigate to the dashboard
    Then I should see an updated layout with a modern design
    And I should see a clear distinction between different sections of the dashboard

  Scenario: Responsive design
    Given I am using a mobile device
    When I access the dashboard
    Then the dashboard UI should be responsive 
    And all elements should adapt to fit the screen size without horizontal scrolling

  Scenario: User-friendly widgets
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When I view the available widgets
    Then I should see intuitive and easy-to-understand widgets
    And I should be able to customize widget settings seamlessly

  Scenario: Enhanced navigation
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When I look for navigation options
    Then I should find an improved menu structure
    And I should be able to access my desired sections within two clicks

  Scenario: Accessibility features
    Given I am a screen reader user
    When I navigate the dashboard
    Then all UI elements should be properly labeled
    And I should be able to understand the content and interact with the dashboard easily

  Scenario: Visual indicators for updates
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When new information is available
    Then I should see visual indicators (like notifications or badges) highlighting the updates
    And I should be able to click on these indicators to view the related information
  
  Scenario: Dark mode option
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When I look for display settings
    Then I should find an option to switch to dark mode
    And the dashboard UI should change to dark mode successfully

  Scenario: Performance improvements
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When I interact with various elements
    Then the dashboard should respond quickly 
    And there should be no noticeable lags or delays during interactions
